Colin Rothwell's Register Machine Interpreter

Runs programs written for a Minksy style register machine. It should be started
with a text file consisting of one instruction per line. Three instruction
formats are supported, where R denotes a register (an arbitrary string: all
registers are intialised to 0) and B denotes a branch (an integer instruction
number to branch to).

R+ B
Adds 1 to R, and branches to B.

R- B B'
Subtracts 1 from R and branches to B if it is greater than 0. If it is equal to
zero, it branches to B'.

halt
Case insensitive: halts execution of the program.
